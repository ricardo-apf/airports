# airports
A simple Go program to get the airports in a given area. 
It needs the user coordinates and the distance in degrees to search. 

After installing the Go runime just type:
$ go run airportsAround.go

And follow the instructions. 


oldAirportdb.go is an alternative algorithm that requires max and min coordinates pairs to search for airports.
